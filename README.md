<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Had to create a **calculator** using JS.

Calculator had to have:
* all digit buttons from 0 to 9
* operation buttons such as +, -, x, /

### Built With
This project was built by mainly using JS, HTML and CSS

### How it went
Well, well, well, what a journey! Who would've thought making a calculator would be so difficult.
I definitely faced a lot of difficulties some of them I've been able to overcome and some... clearly not.

While a lot of information can be found online regarding calculators and js, I've tried to create my own logic in my head
about the functionality of a calculator.
